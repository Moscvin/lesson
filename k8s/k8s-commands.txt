#delete one pod
kubectl delete pod [name_of_pod]

#create deployment for nginx
k create deployment(deploy) [name_of_pod_deployment]

#info about deployment
k describe deploy [name_of_pod_deployment]

#my-nginx-deploy-75488fc988-skx2r = 
my-nginx-deploy = name_of_pod
75488fc988 = same of replica set (indetificators)
skx2r = id for unical pod


#describe for unical pod
kubectl describe pod my-nginx-deploy-75488fc988-skx2r
